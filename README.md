Matrix Multiplication using Threads in C
This code is supposed to read two matrices and thier dimensions from a file and multiply them using threads.
NOTE THAT: the maximum size of the matrices is static.
If you want to multiply two big matrices, you can either implement dynamic allocation or just edit the size manually before running the code.
